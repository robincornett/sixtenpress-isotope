## Frequently Asked Questions

If you are intending to use this plugin on a commercial project (for a client), you need to [purchase a commercial license for Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/license.html). It's easy, takes just a moment, and is worth every penny. _Note: I have no affiliation with Metafizzy.
